    "The collective variables (CVs) [are constructed](https://mlcvs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#) by *combining* a **model** and an **estimator**.\n",
    "- The **model** can be chosen to be **a linear combination** of descriptors or **a non linear transformation** operated by a neural-network.\n",
    "- The **estimators** implemented are Fisher’s discriminant (LDA) and Time-lagged independent component (TICA). While the former allows to devise CVs as the variables which most discriminate between a given set of states, the latter is used to extract CVs as the slowly decorrelating modes of a sampling dynamics.\n",
