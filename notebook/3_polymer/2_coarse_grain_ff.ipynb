    "**What is a coarse-grained (CG) model?**\n",
    "\n",
    "a CG model is used to describe a particle system with a lower resolution than a finer-grained (often atomistic) model. Usually, each particle (or bead) in a CG model represents a group of multiple atoms in the corresponding atomistic model. Equivalently, a group of atoms in an all-atom system are mapped to a single CG site. Several examples of CG mappings are given below.\n",

    "there are multiple choices of possible mappings for the same all-atom system (last figure). Consider a protein as an example: the CG representation can be at a relatively higher resolution (e.g., mapping one residue to one CG site) or lower resolution (e.g., mapping one sub-domain to one CG site). Understanding which mapping is the most appropriate is critical for CG modeling and requires domain specific knowlege. \n",

    "NOTE: Many package and level of coarse-graining are available. Difficult to choose the right one. skip it for now.!!!\n",
