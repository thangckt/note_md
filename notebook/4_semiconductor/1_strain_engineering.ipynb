    "strain can also play an important role in manipulating the electronic and optical properties of TMDCs and graphene. TMDCs have remarkable strength compared with their conventional semiconducting counterparts, allowing the application of **large strains** for band structure manipulation. --> lead to the bourgeoning research on optoelectronic devices based on strain-induced modification of optical and electronic properties.\n",
